- [x] Storage layer integration tests
- [x] Example project validation
- [x] End-to-end manipulation tests

### Development Infrastructure

- [x] Example "basic-hierarchy" project (manufacturing plant)
- [x] Proper module naming (github.com/rgehrsitz/archon)
- [x] CLAUDE.md documentation for AI assistance

### Phase 4: User Interface

- [ ] **UI Components** - Tree navigation, property editors, diff viewers
  - Virtualized tree component for large hierarchies
  - Property editor with type-specific inputs
  - Diff viewer with semantic change display
  - Context menus and keyboard shortcuts

- [ ] **Project Dashboard** - Recent snapshots, sync status, quick actions
  - Project overview and statistics
  - Recent activity and snapshot list
  - Git sync status and controls
  - Quick import/export actions

- [ ] **Hierarchy Workbench** - Multi-pane layout with tree navigation
