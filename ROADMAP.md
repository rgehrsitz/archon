## üéØ Current Focus

**Recommended Next Steps:** Content system complete, move to Import Plugin System

1. **Import Plugin System** - Implement sandboxed JS/TS workers for extensible data import
2. Consider Snapshot System UI integration - Linear history presentation and snapshot comparison UI  
3. Build & Release pipeline for distributing the CLI tools

## üìä Progress Summary

- **Foundation Layer**: ‚úÖ Complete (6/6 major components)
- **Data Extensions**: ‚úÖ Complete (3/3 components)
- **Git & Versioning**: ‚úÖ 3/4 components (Git Integration, Semantic Diff, 3-Way Merge core functionality complete)
- **Content & Plugins**: ‚úÖ 1/3 components (Content-Addressed Attachments complete)
- **User Interface**: ‚è≥ 0/6 components
- **Distribution**: ‚è≥ 1/2 components (CLI Interface core functionality complete)

**Overall Progress**: ~75% complete (foundation + data + git/versioning + content + CLI core features complete)
