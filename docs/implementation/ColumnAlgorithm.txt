I think youj may be overly complicating this.  Here is how I see it (very simplified without edge cases):

Let's assume that we have 7 columns to display, and we have the focus on the top node of the 7th column:

CW = Component Width (inside width of the entire Miller Column component)
RW = Remaining Width (used in loop)
HW = Hidden Width (width of a hidden column)
PW = Partial Width (width of a partially revealed column)
FW = Full Width (width of a fully visible column)

With no hovering going on:

if ((NumberOfColumns - 1) * HW) + (1 * FW) > CW then
  error:  we can't display a single full column plus all of the hidden colummns
else
  continue with calculating the widths of the columns to fit the component

RW = CW
For i = ColumnCount to 1
  if FW + ((ColumnCount - 1) * HW) <= RW then
	RW = RW - FW
	Column(i).width = FW
  else
    RW = RW - HW
	Column(i).width = HW


When hovering over a component:

HC = Hovered Column
For i = HC to ColumnCount
	if Column(i).width = HW then
		Column(i).width = PW
		if i <> HC then //this is not the node being hovered over
			Column(i).leftEdge = Column(i-1).leftEdge + PW
	else
		if Column(i-1).width = PW then //this is the first column after the partially revealed columns
			Column(i).leftEdge = Column(i-1) + PW
		else
			Column(i).leftEdge = Column(i-1) + FW

Thoughts?
