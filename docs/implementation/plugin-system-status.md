# Archon Plugin System - Implementation Status

## *Updated: 2025-08-25*

## Overview

**COMPLETE**: The ADR-013 Backend Host Services implementation is now functionally complete. Both frontend plugin runtime and backend host services are fully integrated and operational. The plugin system can now execute actual plugins with complete access to Archon's core functionality through secure, permission-gated host services.

### 2025-08-25 Update (Backend Host Services COMPLETE)

**ADR-013 Backend Host Services Implementation: ✅ COMPLETE**

- **Frontend-Backend Bridge**: Created complete Wails TypeScript bindings (`PluginService.d.ts`, `PluginService.js`)
- **Type Integration**: Added comprehensive `plugins` namespace to `models.ts` with all backend types
- **Host Services Integration**: Updated `host-services.ts` to call actual backend methods instead of placeholders
- **Full Functionality**: All core host service methods now functional:
  - Repository operations (getNode, listChildren, query, apply mutations)
  - Git operations (commit, snapshot)
  - Network proxy with policy enforcement
  - Secrets management with file-backed store and policy redaction
  - Search indexing (indexPut)
  - UI services integration
- **Verification**: All Go tests pass (30+ tests), Wails build succeeds, integration confirmed

### 2025-08-24 Update (Backend Foundation)

- Standardized zerolog usage across plugin backend (`logger.Info().Msg(...)`).
- Corrected `ProjectService.GetCurrentProject()` usage and plugin directory handling in `internal/api/plugin_service.go`.
- Replaced nonexistent `logging.Global()` with `*logging.GetLogger()` in `app.go`.
- Verified index manager API usage matches `internal/index/index.go`.
- Wired secrets and proxy policies in `PluginService.InitializePluginSystem()`:
  - File-backed secrets store at `.archon/secrets.json` via `FileSecretsStore` wrapped by `PolicySecretsStore` (`secretsPolicy.returnValues` default false)
  - HTTP proxy wrapped by `PolicyProxyExecutor` (enabled when `proxyPolicy` is present in project settings)

- Repository access, Git operations, network proxy, UI, secrets management all functional

### 1.7 Plugin Discovery and Installation

**Status: COMPLETE (frontend)** ✅

- **File**: `frontend/src/lib/plugins/runtime/plugin-manager.ts`

- **Test Files**:
  - `permissions.test.ts` - 23 tests for permission system
  - `manifest.test.ts` - 84 tests for security validation  
  - `csv-importer.test.ts` - 23 tests for plugin functionality

### VSCode Integration

**Status: COMPLETE** ✅

## 🎯 Phase 3: UI & Advanced Features (NEXT)

### Priority Assessment

With the complete plugin runtime and backend integration now operational, these are the logical next areas:

### 3.1 Plugin Manager UI (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Why First**: Users need a way to discover, install, and manage plugins

- Plugin discovery interface
- Installation and uninstallation workflows  
- Permission management interface
- Plugin enable/disable controls

### 3.2 Advanced Plugin Types (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Why Next**: Expand beyond basic importers to showcase full system

- **Panel plugins**: Custom UI panels in the main interface
- **Transformer plugins**: Node data transformation workflows
- **UIContrib plugins**: Custom commands and interface contributions

### 3.3 External Service Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)  

**Why Valuable**: Demonstrate real-world plugin capabilities

- Jira integration plugins (as per ADR-013)
- Authentication and OAuth flows
- External API integration patterns
